Verse 1:
Em                      C
the hardest thing in my life that I've found
Em                   C
is to know yourself, both feet on the ground

          G                             D
it's that truth don't come easy, it's a slippery thing
      C                    Em
I can lie to myself like a bird on the wing


Verse 2:
Em                     C
my mind is complacent, the laziness grows
Em                        C
so simple to coast on the things that you know

     G                         D
I refuse to sit idle while the world passes by
       C                             Em
I will reach out and take it, I will open my mind


Chorus:
C                   G
listen; words are another mind reaching for yours
C                       Em
lean on another; it doesn't mean that you're weak

C             G
let yourself fail and fall; you learn the most when you lose it all

C   D     G  D
and every day
C              Em
give to others more than you take


Verse 2:

    Em                       C
experience saves you from simple mistakes
        Em                         C
and it hardens your heart, a frozen hard lake

      G                      D
let someone else in, let them show you their ways
      C                      Em
break it all down, though you might be afraid


Chorus:
C                   G
listen; words are another mind reaching for yours
C                       Em
lean on another; it doesn't mean that you're weak

C             G
let yourself fail and fall; you learn the most when you lose it all

C   D     G  D
and every day
C              Em
give to others more than you take
