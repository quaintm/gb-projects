Verse 1:
Em                      C
the hardest thing in my life that I've learned
Em                   C
isn't a fact, or how not to get burned

          G                             D
it's that truth don't come easy, it's a slippery thing
      C                    Em
I can lie to myself like a bird on the wing

Em                   C
easy like breathing, but harder to check
Em                             G
we weave our bad habits like a noose round our necks


Verse 2:
Em                     C
my mind is complacent, the laziness grows
Em                        C
so simple to coast on the things that you know

     G                         D
I refuse to sit idle while the world passes by
       C                             Em
I will reach out and take it, I will open my mind

Em                         C
To remind myself of this, for you and for me
Em                          G
I'm making a list of the hardest good deeds


Chorus:
C                   G
listen; there's no need to speak
C                       Em
lean on me; it doesn't mean that you're weak

C             G
let yourself fail and fall
C               Em
limitations are doors and not walls

C   D     G  D
and every day
C              Em
give to others more than you take


Verse 2:
Em                               C
when you push yourself had every day of your life
Em                              C
gather your knowledge, hoard successes and strife

    G                       D
experience saves you from simple mistakes
        Em                         Am
but it also builds walls that are so hard to break

      Em                       C
let someone else in, let them show you their ways
      Em                       G
break down the wall though you might be afraid


Chorus:
C                        G
listen to others without needing to speak
C                          Em
to lean on another doesn't mean that you're weak

C                          G
be willing to let yourself fail and to fall
C                                Em
limitations that stop you can be doors and not walls

C                 D            G        D
at the end of the day when the tally is made
C                    Em
have given to others more than you take
